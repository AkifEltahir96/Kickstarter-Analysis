# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project


### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the degree of success Kickstarter campaigns have in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. Louise wants to complete this analysis to evaluate how her campaign compares to other campaigns worldwide.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

First, I created a pivot table to analyze the success of Kickstarter campaigns based on launch date [picture]. Through the pivot table, I filtered data by month of Kickstarter campaign launch (Years) and type of Kickstarter campaign (Parent Category) [picture]. Next, I only included campaigns that were successful, failed, or canceled [picture]. I did not include live campaigns because those are currently ongoing. Since Fever is a theater Kickstarter campaign, I filtered the data through type of Kickstarter campagin to only show theater campaigns [picture]. This will allow for a more relevant comparison. Finally, I created a line chart to  visualize the relationship between launch month and Kickstarter campaign outcomes. The chart can be viewed here (C:\Users\Owner\Desktop\Excel Module\Crowdfunding Analysis\Resources\Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png).

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Only challenge I had was the one I explained to Mark.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

One conclusion you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date is that 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A few other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create involve comparisons of different countries to see how theatre Kickstarter campaigns
